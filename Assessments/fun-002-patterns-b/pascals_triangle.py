def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Generates Pascal's triangle and returns the final row as a list.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The row number of Pascal's triangle to generate (0-based index).

    Returns:
    list: The final row of Pascal's triangle as a list.

    Formula for Pascal's Triangle:
    Each element in Pascal's triangle can be calculated using the following formula:

    C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)

    Where:
    - n is the row number (0-based index)
    - k is the column number (0-based index)
    - C(n, k) represents the value at row n and column k in Pascal's triangle
    - n! represents the factorial of n

    To generate a row of Pascal's triangle, iterate over the columns from 0 to n.
    Calculate each element using the formula and store them in a list to form the row.
    Repeat this process for each row up to the desired row number.

    Example:
     * Input: n = 6
     * Output:
     *           1
     *         1   1
     *       1   2   1
     *     1   3   3   1
     *   1   4   6   4   1
     * 1   5  10   10  5   1
