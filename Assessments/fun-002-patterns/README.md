# Mini Assessment - Patterns

Modify `patterns.py` to complete the assessment, see docstrings for reference. The tests are located in `tests/test_patterns.py`, which will guide your implementation.

You can run the program using the instructions in the section **To Run** below. You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as described in **To Test** below. 

To pass the required unittest, ensure that all functions in `patterns.py` are implemented correctly according to the specifications outlined in the docstrings.

## To Run

```bash
python3 patterns.py
```

Follow the input prompts to execute your program.

## To Test

To run all the unittests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests/test_pattern.py
```

To run a specific step's unittest, e.g., step 1:

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_patterns.MyTestCase.test_1_shape
```

**Note:** Do NOT edit the tests.

## Learning Outcomes Assessed:

- Understanding and implementing functions
- Handling user input and validation
- Utilising control structures (loops and conditionals)
- Working with data structures (lists, etc.)
- Implementing algorithms for shape drawing
- Problem-solving skills through algorithm design
